# Installing Python and Setting up a Virtual Environment

## Python Installation Options

- Mac or Windows users can download open source Python for free from
python.org.  
- Mac users can also use Homebrew to install Python.  
- Linux users can use the package managers like apt (Ubuntu, Debian), dnf
(Fedora), or yum (CentOS).  
- Anaconda is a free open source data science platform that is available to
Windows, Mac and Linux platforms.  
If you are new to Python and using Windows or a Mac, you might want to start with
python.org as there is help and a community available.

## Python Virtual Environment

A Python virtual environment is useful for creating a project that depends on installed packages. Packages give Python access to code functionality beyond the basic language.  
If you do not use a virtual environment and install a Python package globally, you may run into problems when different projects require different versions of a package. The virtual environment allows you to select the versions that you need for the project youâ€™re working on.  

With a virtual environment in place you can rely on **Isolation** , **Cleanliness** and **Reproducibility**.  
- **Isolation:** Prevents conflicts between dependencies of different projects. Project A might need libraryX version 1.0, while Project B needs libraryX version
2.0. With virtual environments, each project can have its specific dependencies
without clashing.
- **Cleanliness**: Keep your global Python installation clean and free from
project-specific clutter.
- **Reproducibility**: Makes it easier to share your project with others. You can provide a requirements.txt file (generated with `pip freeze >
requirements.txt`) that lists all project dependencies, allowing others to
easily recreate your environment.

## Anaconda

The Python Anaconda installation provides a virtual environment. If you are using a
[python.org](https://www.python.org/) or [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python) install, you will need to set up your own virtual environments.
A virtual environment is associated with a directory on your file system.
If you are using Anaconda already, you can continue to use it for this course.

### Setting Up Virtual Environments

If you're using Python downloaded directly from python.org (or installed via a
package manager like apt on Linux, brew on macOS, or a standard Windows installer,
as opposed to Anaconda), the standard and recommended way to create a virtual
environment is using the built-in venv module.
Here are the instructions:

## Creating a Virtual Environment with venv

Note: These instructions assume you can use Bash or Zsh commands. If you are using a Mac, you likely use Zsh which uses the same commands as Bash. If you are using Windows, you can install Git Bash or WSL:
- [Git Install](https://git-scm.com/downloads)  When you install **git for Windows** there is an option to install **Git Bash for Windows**. If you select this you will have access to a command line interface where you can enter Bash commands.
- [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) is an acronum for  **Windows Subsystem for Linux**.  It will allow you to execute Bash commands in a Windows operating system.

## venv Modules

The venv module is included with Python 3.3 and later, so you don't need to install
anything extra.  
**Step 1: Open Terminal or Command Prompt**  
- **Windows:** Search for "cmd" or "Command Prompt" in the Start Menu and open it.  
- **macOS / Linux:** Open your "Terminal" application.  

**Step 2: Navigate to Your Project Directory (Optional but Recommended)**  
It's good practice to **create your virtual environment inside your project's main
directory**. If you don't have one yet, you can create one.  

```bash
# Create a new directory for your project
mkdir my_python_project 

# Change into that directory 
cd my_python_project
```

If you already have a project directory, navigate into it:  

```bash
cd path/to/your/existing_project
```

**Step 3: Create the Virtual Environment**  
Once you are in your desired directory, run the following command to create a virtual environment. You can name the environment anything you like, but common
conventions are `venv`, `.venv`, or `env`.  

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

- `python`: This invokes your Python interpreter. If you have multiple Python
versions installed, you might need to use python3 or py (on Windows,
sometimes py -3.9 for a specific version).
- `-m venv`: This tells Python to run the venv module as a script.   
- `venv`: This is the name of the directory where your virtual environment will be
created. You can replace venv with any name you prefer (e.g., `myenv`, `env`,
`.venv`). 

This command will create a new directory (e.g., `venv`) in your current location. Inside this directory, you'll find a copy of the Python interpreter, pip, and other necessary files for an isolated environment.  

**Step 4: Activate the Virtual Environment**  
After creation, you need to "activate" the virtual environment. Activating it modifies your terminal's PATH variable for that session so that python, pip, and jupyter (if installed in the venv) refer to the executables within the virtual environment, not your global Python installation.  

**For Windows**:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

**For macOS / Linux**:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Step 5: Verify Activation (Optional)**
Once activated, your terminal prompt will usually change to indicate the active virtual environment (e.g., `(venv)` at the beginning of the line).You can also verify by checking the Python interpreter being used:  

** Mac or Linux**
 ```bash
which python
python --version  
```  

**On Windows**
```bash
where python
```
This should show the path to the Python executable within your venv directory.  

Next check the pip version:

```bash
pip --version
```  

This should also show that pip is associated with your venv.  

**Step 6: Install Packages within the Virtual Environment**  

Now that your virtual environment is active, you can install any Python packages you need for your project using **pip**. These packages will be installed **only** within this virtual environment and will not affect your global Python installation or other virtual environments.  

```bash
pip install jupyter pandas
```

**Step 7: Launch Jupyter Notebook (if installed in venv)**  

If you installed jupyter within your active virtual environment you can launch a web page that allows you to create and use [Juypter Notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/). 

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will launch Jupyter Notebook using the Python and packages from your activated
venv.  

**Step 8: Deactivate the Virtual Environment**
When you're done working on your project or want to switch to another environment,
simply type:

```bash
deactivate
```

Your terminal prompt will return to normal, and python, pip, etc., will once again refer to your global Python installation.
